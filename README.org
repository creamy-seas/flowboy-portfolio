Build of a static website based on =clojure=:
- =.html=: [[file:src/clj/][clojure]] to generate the static stuff, evaluating the [[file:data/][csv]] data and baking it into the window property
- =.js=: [[file:src/cljs/][clojurescript]] for stuff like gallery interactivity, that will use the =#id= tags in the =html= to manipulate state and properties
- =.css=: [[file:src/css/input.css][tailwind]] and =daisyuo= to inject nice =css= props and build a minified =css= file
- [[file:resources/public/assets/][Assets]]: some will be served by the site, other [[file:src/python/gsync.py][fetched from google]]

The build script populate the [[file:resources/public/][public]] folder that can be served statically.

* Running
** Prepare the [[*CSV files][CSV files]]
| *File*         | *Description*                                                               |
|----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [[file:data/highlights.csv][highlights.csv]] | Big events, newest at top                                                   |
| [[file:data/game_stats.org][game_stats.org]] | Game by game stats                                                          |
| [[file:data/time_log.csv][time_log.csv]]   | Cumulative ice time per season                                              |
| [[file:data/gallery.csv][gallery.csv]]    | All of the photos. *Note - these are generated by the python script below!* |

** Building
1. Install node and python dependencies - it will also pull in the graphjs blob
#+begin_src shell
npm i && python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
#+end_src

2. [@2] Run a dev (with live reload) or build scripts
#+begin_src shell
npm run dev # for development build with watching
npm run build # for production build
#+end_src

3. [@3] Test the code
#+begin_src shell
npm run lint
#+end_src

4. [@4] Preview (if not already running) and publish
#+begin_src shell
npm run preview
npm run publish # to push to github pages
#+end_src

** Upload photos
1. Setup google if not setup (see below)
2. Create a folder (folders) with the following season structure
#+begin_text
highlights/
├── 2021-2022
├── 2022-2023
├── 2023-2024
└── 2024-2025
#+end_text

3. [@3] Create the =.env= file of following format. =MEDIA_PATHS= for the folders you created should be delimited with =:=
#+begin_src text
GOOGLE_SECRETS_FILE = XXXX.json
GOOGLE_FOLDER = XXXX
MEDIA_PATHS=/folder-1:/folder-path/folder-2
#+end_src

4. [@4] Run the sync script
#+begin_src python
python src/python/gsync.py
#+end_src

* Tips and tricks
** =.clj=
*** New pages
- Any page should be defined in the [[file:src/clj/pages/][src/clj/pages]] folder with a single =render= function defined in the =page.clj= file of that folder.
- Then call this =render= function in [[file:src/clj/dev/build_clj.clj][src/clj/dev/build_clj.clj]]
#+begin_src clojure
(def pages
  {"resources/public/index.html"         pages.landing.page/render
   "resources/public/404.html"           pages.error.page/render
   "resources/public/gallery/index.html" pages.gallery.page/render})
#+end_src
*** no-js
If =javascript= is disabled, we will want to skip or replace the js-dependent components.

Do this by giving them the =js-only= and =no-js-only= class tags - the script in the head will show/hide the relevant elements

*** Config
Any config fields should be defined in [[file:resources/config.edn][resources/config.edn]] and imported using

#+begin_src clojure
(:require [utils.config :refer [config]])
#+end_src
** =.css=
With tailwind, the [[file:tailwind.config.js][config]] file defines which files to search for tailwind classes e.g. =text-center=. It does a full text search and only includes those in a minified css file.

** =.cljs=
*** New page
- All functions for a single page should be collected in a dedicated folder with a =build.cljs= file in [[file:src/cljs/][src/cljs]]
- Then define the bundle in [[file:src/cljs/dev/build_cljs.clj][src/cljs/dev/build_cljs.clj]], with the key being the name of the =js= file to be created and the value the build file that imports all your invividual files
#+begin_src clojure
(def ^:private bundles
  {:gallery 'gallery.build
   :landing 'landing.build})
#+end_src

*** Name mangling
As the =cljs= files are compiled and minified with the =cljs= compiler, variable names can be mangled. For most common =js= DOM operations e.g. =document.language= etc there are export names that prevent mangling.

But for custom libraries e.g. =chartjs=, internal variable names, that the =chartjs.min.js= downloaded from the server expects, get malformed. As such, ensure that you use =aget= instead of =-.PROP= to access fields

#+begin_src clojure
-                   (let [idx   (js/parseInt (.-dataIndex item))
+                   (let [idx   (js/parseInt (aget item "dataIndex"))
#+end_src

*** Compiling
- The =cljs= compiler does a good job at slimming the build and can be used as is.
- I looked at using it to create an intermediate output and then using =rollup= to bundle and trim further: commit 2917629
- It seemed to be worse as per table below as it did not group common things

| =cljs=                           | =gallery.js=       | 2.55k |

* Google setup
1. Go to [[https://console.cloud.google.com/][Google Cloud]] and create a new project
2. Go to Go to [[https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard?authuser=6&inv=1&invt=Ab2i1A&project=hockey-portfolio][APIs & Services > Library]] and enable the *Google Drive API*
3. [[https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/clients/create?previousPage=%2Fapis%2Fcredentials%3Fauthuser%3D6%26inv%3D1%26invt%3DAb2rWA%26project%3Dhockey-portfolio&authuser=6&inv=1&invt=Ab2rWA&project=hockey-portfolio][Create client OAuth client ID]] for *External User* and *Desktop App*. Add email to test users and don't spam it!
4. Download json and store locally, setting it in =GOOGLE_SECRETS_FILE= in =.env=
5. Create the =GOOGLE_FOLDER= and give it public access
